# Matrix C — Operator Implementation Matrix

**Document ID:** BANZA-VALIDATION-MATRIX-C-001  
**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Authority:** ADR-025, ADR-028, BANZA_CERTIFICATION.md  
**Layer:** Certified Operators (implementation)  
**Status:** CANONICAL

---

## Purpose

Matrix C defines the generic operator implementation model. Any certified BANZA operator — regardless of brand, geography, or product — must satisfy the requirements in this matrix for its declared certification level.

This matrix contains no operator names. No operator brand appears here. Any certified operator must fit this model.

---

## Operator Independence Principle

Each operator is an independent commercial entity. Operators:
- Implement the BANZA protocol against this matrix
- Seek certification from BANZA
- Use BanzAI (optionally) to assess readiness
- Never modify protocol invariants
- Never modify contract schemas
- Never modify conformance vectors

An operator cannot certify itself. Only BANZA issues certificates.

## Status Model

| Status | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| `REQUIRED` | Mandatory for the declared certification level |
| `CONDITIONAL` | Required only when the associated capability is declared |
| `OPTIONAL` | Not required but compatible with the protocol |
| `PROHIBITED` | Explicitly forbidden by protocol invariant |
| `OPERATOR-SPECIFIC` | Outside the protocol scope — operator's own responsibility |

## Category 9: Operator-Specific (Outside Protocol Scope)

These items are the operator's own responsibility. They are not specified by the BANZA protocol, not tested by the conformance suite, and not certified by BANZA.

| Item | Classification | Note |
|------|---------------|------|
| KYC / AML / identity verification | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Regulatory requirement; operator's legal obligation |
| Consumer mobile app | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Not a protocol surface |
| Merchant dashboard | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Not a protocol surface |
| Fee structures | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator commercial decision |
| Consumer credit products | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator product |
| Fraud detection and risk scoring | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator responsibility |
| Production infrastructure | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator responsibility |
| CI/CD and deployment | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator responsibility |
| Regulatory licensing | OPERATOR-SPECIFIC | Operator legal obligation |
| Operator-specific extensions to the protocol | PROHIBITED | Extensions must go through the ADR/RFC process |

---

## Conformance Vector Map

Any operator targeting a given level must pass all vectors for that level and all levels below it.

| Level | Required vectors | Runner |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| L0 | Sandbox health, wallet, transfer | `tools/banza-conformance/run.py --level 0` |
| L1 | L0 + QR, payment-requests, ledger, settlement | `run.py --level 1` |
| L2 | L1 + traces, webhooks, dynamic QR, payment links | `run.py --level 2` |
| L3 | L2 + all FED-* suites (79 tests) | `run_fed.py` |
| L4 | L3 + infrastructure suite | Not yet available (v1.1) |

---

## Summary

This matrix is operator-neutral. No operator brand names appear. No operator is privileged. Every certified BANZA operator is subject to the same requirements at each level.

The conformance suite is the authority. BanzAI guidance helps reach it. BANZA certification confirms it.
