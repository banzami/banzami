# Matrix A — BANZA Validation Matrix

**Document ID:** BANZA-VALIDATION-MATRIX-A-001  
**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Authority:** ADR-025, ADR-026, ADR-028, ADR-029  
**Layer:** BANZA Protocol (authoritative)  
**Status:** CANONICAL

---

## Purpose

Matrix A defines the canonical validation scope of the BANZA Protocol layer. Every item in this matrix is owned, maintained, and enforced by BANZA. No operator and no other system may override, weaken, or substitute for any item classified COMPLETE in this matrix.

This matrix is the ground truth for what BANZA certifies. BanzAI (Matrix B) evaluates against it. Operators (Matrix C) implement against it.

## Status Model

| Status | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| `COMPLETE` | Exists, tested, and enforced (CI gate or automated test) |
| `IN-PROGRESS` | Exists but not all tests pass, or not yet deployed |
| `DEFERRED` | Planned for v1.1 or later; not required for v1.0 |
| `MISSING` | Required for v1.0 production but does not yet exist |

## Confidence Model

| Confidence | Definition |
|-----------|-----------|
| `HIGH` | Enforced by automated tests, CI, or cryptographic verification |
| `MEDIUM` | Documented, reviewed, and manually verified |
| `LOW` | Specified in ADR/RFC but not yet tested or enforced |

## Audit Model

Every COMPLETE item must satisfy at least one of:
- Referenced by an accepted ADR
- Covered by a conformance test vector
- Enforced by a CI gate (`make identity-check`, `conformance.yml`, etc.)

## Dependency Model

```
Contracts → Invariants → Conformance → Certification
```

No conformance vector may test something not specified in a contract. No certification level may require something not covered by a conformance vector.
