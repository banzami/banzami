## Instructions

This checklist is a companion to `ROOT_KEY_CEREMONY_PROCEDURE.md`. It does not replace the procedure — it tracks execution. For the steps that require exact commands, follow the Procedure document.

Mark each checkbox as completed. If a step cannot be completed, write the reason in the margin and consult the failure procedures in the Procedure document §Part VI.

**Print this document. Fill it in by hand. Sign it at the end. Keep the signed original in the Ceremony Record package.**
